        <p>Please review the following policies before booking our services. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out.</p>

            <h2>Booking & Reservations</h2>
            <p>All events require a signed service agreement and a non-refundable deposit to secure your date. Deposit amounts vary depending on the scope of services and will be outlined in your custom proposal. We recommend booking as early as possible, as dates fill quickly — especially during peak seasons.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="policy-section">
            <h2>Payment Terms</h2>
            <p>A 50% deposit is required at the time of booking to reserve your date. The remaining balance is due no later than 14 days prior to your event. We accept checks, credit cards, and electronic transfers. A 3% processing fee applies to credit card payments.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="policy-section">
            <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
            <p>Cancellations made 60 or more days before the event date will forfeit the deposit only. Cancellations within 30–59 days will be charged 50% of the total contract amount. Cancellations within 30 days of the event are non-refundable. We understand that circumstances change — please contact us as soon as possible if you need to reschedule or cancel.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="policy-section">
            <h2>Guest Count & Menu Changes</h2>
            <p>Final guest counts and menu selections are due 10 business days prior to your event. Increases to guest count after this date will be accommodated when possible but may be subject to additional fees. Decreases to guest count after the final confirmation will not result in a reduction of the quoted price.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="policy-section">
            <h2>Travel & Delivery</h2>
            <p>Events within a 30-mile radius of our base location are included in standard pricing. Events beyond this range may be subject to a travel fee, which will be included in your proposal. Setup and breakdown times will be coordinated with your venue and outlined in the service agreement.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="policy-section">
            <h2>Liability & Insurance</h2>
            <p>Gather Catering and Events carries full liability insurance for all events we service. Clients are responsible for obtaining any permits required by their venue or local regulations, including alcohol service permits when applicable. We are happy to assist with the permitting process.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="policy-section">
            <h2>Food Safety & Allergies</h2>
            <p>Our team follows all local health and food safety regulations. Please inform us of any dietary restrictions or allergies when planning your menu. While we take every precaution, we cannot guarantee a completely allergen-free environment and are not responsible for allergic reactions.</p>
